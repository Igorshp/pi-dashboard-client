Raspberry Pi Dashboard client
=============================

Lightweight chrome controller for raspberry pi.

By itself it doesn't do much. It's a 'backend' for dashboard-tv-ui project that helps administer a number of tv dashboards.


Features:
=========

- Set current url
- get screenshot
- remembers last used url and tries to recover to it on start
- stores history of urls




TODO:
====

- add upload home image feature
- add go to home button
- styling
- logs (since ther eare no users, at least ip of who made the change)


Maybe:
=====

- rename the pi (both hostname and clean name)
- change passwords
- headers for certain sites (e.g. to pass auth)
- auth?
